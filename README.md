# MeetGreet-Infrastructure

This package hold the code for MeetGreet's Infrastructure. This includes the SQL commands used to create our Database and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) code used to provision our RDS MYSQL Server and S3 Bucket hosted via AWS.

Currently, MeetGreet is configured to connect to the resources hosted on our (the creators) AWS account but you can create and AWS account and provision these resources yourself using the AWS-Infrastructure-As-Code folder if you wish. Please see the ReadMe present in the AWS-Infrastructure-As-Code folder for steps on how this can be done. Please note that provisioning these resources to an AWS account of your own may result in charges being incurred to your account. 

***See the AWS-Infrastructure-As-Code package for the ReadMe outlining how to deploy MeetGreet's AWS Infrastructure.***

***See the MYSQL folder for the SQL commands used to create a 1:1 replica of MeetGreet's SQL database.***

Thank you!
